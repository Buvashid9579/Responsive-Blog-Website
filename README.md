My Portfolio Blog
This is a simple, responsive web application for creating and managing a personal blog. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it provides a full-featured, single-page experience for users to write and save their thoughts.

Key Features
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Blog Posts: Users can write new blog posts, save them, edit existing ones, and delete posts they no longer want.

Persistent Data Storage: All blog posts are saved directly in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your content remains even after you close the tab.

Interactive Mood Tracker: A small interactive element on the homepage allows users to record their mood for the day and receive a personalized message.

Single-Page Application (SPA): The entire blog is contained within a single HTML file, providing a seamless user experience without page reloads.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and semantic markup of the application.

CSS3: For all styling, including a modern, clean design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, including DOM manipulation and data management.
